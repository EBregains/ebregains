## Hi there 👋

 &ensp;&ensp; I am Emiliano. Passionate and self-taught in the realm of software, with a deep love for learning, problem-solving, and unleashing creative designs.
While I am currently working as an HMI developer and designer, I like to use my spare time to improve my skills in Web Dev.  
 &ensp;&ensp; Speak english, spanish and a little bit of norwegian and deutsch.
